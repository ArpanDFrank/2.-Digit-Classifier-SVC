Project: Digit Classifier using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Introduction:
In the realm of machine learning, image classification is a fundamental task. One classic problem is recognizing handwritten digits. In this project, we will implement a digit classifier using the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm. SVC is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that can classify data by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in feature space.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on pixel values of images.

Dataset:
We will use the popular MNIST dataset which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Implementation:

Data Preparation:

Load the MNIST dataset.
Preprocess the data by scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1] and flattening the images into 1D arrays.
Model Training:

Initialize an SVC classifier.
Train the classifier using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Perform grid search or random search to optimize hyperparameters such as C (regularization parameter) and kernel type.
Use cross-validation to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
Model Deployment:

Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, deploy it for real-world use.
Develop a simple user interface where users can draw digits and the model predicts the digit.


To embark on the Digit Classifier project utilizing Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for handwritten digit recognition and retrieve stored image data using OpenCV (cv2), several Python packages and dependencies are necessary. Below is a guide on how to install these packages using pip:

NumPy: NumPy is essential for numerical computing and handling arrays, which are fundamental in image processing and machine learning tasks.
pip install numpy

Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn provides a wide array of machine learning algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and more.
pip install scikit-learn

OpenCV (cv2): OpenCV is a popular library for computer vision tasks, including image manipulation, processing, and feature extraction.
pip install opencv-python-headless

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is useful for visualizing data and model performance, aiding in the analysis and interpretation of results.
pip install matplotlib
