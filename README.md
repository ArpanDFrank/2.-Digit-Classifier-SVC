# Digit-Classifier-SVC-
 Project: Digit Classifier using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)   Objective: The primary goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on pixel values of images.  Dataset: We will use the popular MNIST dataset which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits.
